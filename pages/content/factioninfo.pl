<h3>General</h3>

<p>
This document includes mainly the information that's available only on
the faction boards + a short summary of other special aspects of the
faction.
For exact information on the ice and volcano terrain types and on the
details of the faction special powers, please read the
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/105387/english-rule-book">Fire & Ice rulebook</a>. 

<p>
A note on <b>home terrain</b>: The concept of home terrain only applies to the original 14 factions from the base game and the shapeshifters. The other 5 expansion factions have a starting terrain but no home terrain.

<h4 id="icemaidens">Ice Maidens</h4>

<ul>
<li> Start with 6/6/0 power, 0/1/0/1 on cults.
<li> Start with a favor tile (taken immediately on faction selection). Note that FAV11 scores no points for initial dwellings.
<li> Advancing on the digging track requires just 5c+1w+1p (discount of 1w).

</ul>

<h4 id="yetis">Yetis</h4>

<ul>
<li> Start with 0/12/0 power, 0/0/1/1 on cults.
<li> Have a discount of one power on the power actions (so act4 costs 3pw, not 4pw).
<li> Advancing on the digging track requires just 5c+1w+1p (discount of 1w).
<li> SH costs 6c+4w, produces 4pw, and allows the Yetis to take any power action that they can pay for, even if it has already been taken during that round. The same power action can be taken multiple times, regardless of how many times and by whom it has been taken.
<li> SA costs 6c+4w.
<li> The SH and SA have a power level of 4 for leeching / forming towns, instead of the normal 3.

</ul>

<h4 id=acolytes>Acolytes</h4>

<ul>
<li> Start with 6/6/0 power, 3/3/3/3 on cults
<li> Have no base worker income (no worker produced with no dwellings). The 4th dwelling produces no worker income.
<li> SH costs 8c+4w, produces 2pw, and gives the Acolytes one extra cult step for each priest sent to the cult tracks.

<li> If the Acolytes gain a spade from somewhere, they'll gain a cult step instead.
<li> The Acolytes do not gain power from the cult track thresholds when going down on a cult, but do gain the power every time they pass the threshold when going up. If they leave the 10 space on a cult, it's free to be taken again by either the Acolytes or another faction.
</ul>
